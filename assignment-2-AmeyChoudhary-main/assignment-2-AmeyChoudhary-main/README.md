## Part 1: PCA

#### My Observations for PCA on pictionary dataset are that on reducing the number of features, the accuracy does drop. It regains its accuracy after a certain number of features. It peaks at 128 in resnet and 64 in vit. These are the number of important features. After this, on adding features, the dataset becomes noisy.

## Part 2: GMM

#### Implemented the functionalities.

## Part 3: Hierarchical Clustering

#### I am doing agglomerative clustering.
#### I am varying the linkage and distance types.
#### I am also randomly dropping columns to see how it affects the clustering and written my observations in the notebook.

## Part 4

#### For first part, I have explained the workflow in the notebook.
#### For second part, I have used the code from the notebook and modified it to work with the dataset. I have also added the code for the second part in the notebook.
#### For third part, I have generated the distributions.
